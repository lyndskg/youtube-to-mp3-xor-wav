Sure! Based on your requirements for high cross-platform compatibility, code reuse, and ease of collaboration between Python, C#, and C++ expertise, I recommend the following tech stack:

**Tech Stack: Python + C++ (with Qt) + React**

1. **Frontend (User Interface):**
   - React: For building the web frontend, providing a fast and interactive user experience.
   - Qt (C++): For building the desktop applications (macOS and Windows), providing native-like UI and cross-platform compatibility.

2. **Backend (Data Processing and Business Logic):**
   - Python: For handling backend logic, data processing, and integrating with web APIs.

3. **Database (Data Storage):**
   - SQLite: For lightweight, serverless, and easy-to-use data storage for both the web app and desktop app.

4. **APIs, Frameworks, and Libraries:**
   - Flask (Python): For creating the web API and handling server-side functionality.
   - Qt (C++): For building cross-platform desktop applications with native-like UI.

5. **Web APIs and HTTP Communication:**
   - Flask (Python): For creating RESTful APIs to communicate between the frontend and backend.

6. **User Interface Design and Styling:**
   - React: For modern and interactive UI design for the web app.
   - Qt (C++): For building native-looking UI for the desktop apps.

7. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Python Logging: For error handling and logging on the server-side (web app).
   - Qt (C++): For error handling and logging on the desktop applications.

8. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
   - Jest (JavaScript): For frontend testing in React.
   - Pytest (Python): For backend testing in Flask.
   - Google Test (C++): For testing C++ code.

9. **Desktop Application Development (Cross-platform):**
   - Qt (C++): For building native-like desktop applications that work on macOS and Windows with a single codebase.

10. **Audio Conversion:**
   - FFmpeg (C++): For audio conversion functionalities within the desktop applications.

11. **Metadata Processing:**
   - Python: For handling metadata processing and integration with AI/ML models.

12. **AI/ML Integration:**
   - Python: For integrating AI/ML models for metadata retrieval or generation.

13. **Collaboration and Code Reuse:**
   - Python, C++, and React: By using these languages and frameworks, you can collaborate effectively between Python, C#, and C++ experts and reuse code for the web app and desktop apps where possible, minimizing code duplication.

This tech stack combines the power and flexibility of Python, C++, and React to provide high cross-platform compatibility, code reuse, and ease of collaboration for your project. The use of Qt ensures native-like UI for the desktop apps, and the integration of Flask and SQLite allows for efficient backend development and data storage for the web app. With this stack, you can build a robust and feature-rich application that works seamlessly across different platforms and leverages the strengths of each language and framework.

For the Python + C++ (with Qt) + React tech stack, you'll need separate Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for Python, C++, and JavaScript/React development. Here are some popular IDE options for each language:

1. Python IDE: PyCharm
   - PyCharm is a widely used IDE for Python development. It provides features like code completion, debugging, testing, and integration with popular web frameworks like Django and Flask.

2. C++ IDE: Qt Creator
   - Qt Creator is an excellent choice for C++ development with Qt. It offers advanced tools for Qt application development, including GUI designer, code editor, and project management capabilities.

3. JavaScript/React IDE: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
   - Visual Studio Code is a versatile IDE with excellent support for JavaScript and React development. It offers a rich set of extensions that can enhance your development experience with features like IntelliSense, debugging, and Git integration.

Using PyCharm for Python development, Qt Creator for C++ with Qt, and Visual Studio Code for JavaScript/React will provide a well-rounded development environment for your tech stack. Additionally, these IDEs have extensive plugin ecosystems, making it easier to collaborate and integrate various tools and utilities as needed for your project.
