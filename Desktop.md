## Basic Ideas
1. __<ins>Front-end</ins>: (*User Interface*)__
   - For desktop apps, the frontend will be the user interface of the application. You can use the GUI libraries provided by the chosen desktop app framework (*e.g.*, `PyQt` or `Tkinter` or `Kivy`) to create the user interface using widgets and layouts.
      - `React Native`: A framework for building cross-platform mobile applications with `React.js` components.
      - `Flutter`: A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.&nbsp;
     
2. **<ins>Back-end</ins>:**
   1. *Languages*:
      - `Python`
      - `C#`
   2. *Frameworks*:
      - `Flask`: A lightweight and flexible Python web framework that can also be used for desktop app back-end functionality.
      - `Django`: A high-level Python web framework that promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
      - `.NET Core`: A cross-platform, open-source framework for building modern applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

3.  **<ins>Libraries and APIs</ins>:**
   - `Electron Forge`: A complete toolchain to package and distribute `Electron.js` applications.
   - `Node.js child_process module`: For running `FFmpeg` and other command-line utilities.
   - `Spotify Web API`: For accessing music metadata and related information.
  
4. **<ins>Database(s)</ins>:**
   - Since you are building a desktop app, you might not need a full-fledged database system like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
   - Instead, you can use SQLite, a lightweight, embedded database that doesn't require a separate server. SQLite is suitable for small to medium-sized desktop applications.

&nbsp;

<h2>II. &nbsp; Python-Based Tech Stacks</h2>

### **Front-end: (UI)** 

Since you are building a desktop app for macOS, you'll need a framework that supports macOS app development.\
For the frontend of your desktop app, you can use Python's built-in GUI libraries or other third-party frameworks that support macOS app development. 
&nbsp;

<em>Some options <strong>include</strong></em>:
> - `PyQt`:
>    - A set of Python bindings for the `Qt` application framework, which allows you to build cross-platform desktop applications, including macOS.
>    - It provides a wide range of features and widgets for building a rich and interactive user interface.
>
> - `Tkinter`:
>    - A built-in Python GUI library that provides basic functionalities to create simple desktop applications on macOS and other platforms.
>    - Python's standard GUI library and comes bundled with Python.
>    - It offers basic GUI functionalities and is a good choice for simple desktop applications.
>
> - `Kivy`:
>    - An open-source Python library for developing multitouch applications.
>    - It supports various platforms, including macOS, and is well-suited for creating touch-friendly interfaces.


If you are comfortable with Python and would like to stick with it for your desktop app's development, that's a great choice and can simplify the entire process.\
In this case, you won't need to use `ASP.NET Core` or any other technology outside of Python.


### **Back-end:**
For the backend of your desktop app, you can still use Python with frameworks like `Flask` or `Django`, but the focus will shift from web-related tasks to app-specific functionalities.

Both `Flask` and `Django` are excellent choices, depending on the complexity and requirements of your desktop app:
>
> - `Django`: A high-level web framework known for its simplicity and robustness.
>    - It follows the "don't repeat yourself" (DRY) principle and provides many built-in features, such as an ORM for database interactions and a user authentication system.
>
> - `Flask`: A micro-framework that offers more flexibility and control over the project's structure.
>    - It's lightweight and allows you to choose your preferred libraries and components, making it suitable for smaller desktop applications.

&nbsp;

### **Database:**

Since you are building a desktop app, you might not need a full-fledged database system like `PostgreSQL` or `MySQL`.


Instead, you can use `SQLite`, a lightweight, embedded database that doesn't require a separate server.\
`SQLite` is suitable for small to medium-sized desktop applications.
 

Overall, the main difference is that you'll be developing a standalone desktop application that runs directly on macOS, rather than a web application that requires a web server and a browser to access.\
The choice of framework and tools will be influenced by the specific requirements of desktop app development and macOS compatibility.



### **Packaging and Distribution:**
When building desktop apps, you'll need to consider packaging and distributing your application to macOS users. 


Tools like `PyInstaller` or `cx_Freeze` can help you package your Python code into standalone executables for macOS, making it easy for users to install and run your app without requiring a Python interpreter.



###  **Integration with macOS Features:**
You can take advantage of macOS-specific features and integrations, such as using native macOS menus, notifications, and system functionalities.


As you are targeting macOS, consider taking advantage of macOS-specific features and integrations to enhance the user experience.\
You can use libraries or modules that provide access to macOS functionalities (*e.g.*, menus, notifications, and system services).


### **Deployment:**
Consider how you will deploy the desktop app to your users.\
You might choose to distribute it through the macOS App Store or provide it as a downloadable package from your website.


When your desktop app is ready for deployment, you can distribute it through various channels.\
You might choose to share it as a downloadable package from your website or distribute it through the macOS App Store if you prefer a centralized distribution platform.


By sticking to Python for both frontend and backend development, you and your friend can leverage your Python expertise efficiently.


Python has a vast number of libraries and frameworks that can assist in various aspects of desktop app development, making it a versatile and powerful choice. 


Just ensure that you follow best practices and design patterns specific to desktop application development and strive to create a secure and user-friendly experience.


Happy coding!

### DB OR NAH

If your project is a desktop application, the need for a database will depend on the nature of the application and the data it deals with. Here are some factors to consider when deciding whether to use a database in your desktop app:

1. **Data Storage and Management:** Does your desktop application involve storing and managing data? If your app handles user-generated content, settings, configurations, or any form of data that needs to persist between application sessions, using a database would be beneficial.

2. **Offline Usage and Data Synchronization:** If your desktop app needs to work offline and synchronize data with a remote server or cloud storage when connected to the internet, a database can help facilitate this process.

3. **Performance and Scalability:** Databases are efficient at handling and querying large datasets. If your desktop app deals with significant amounts of data or requires complex data operations, a database can enhance performance and scalability.

4. **Security:** If your desktop application deals with sensitive data, using a database can provide a more secure way to store and manage this information compared to other storage options.

5. **User Management:** If your desktop app involves user accounts and authentication, a database is essential for securely storing user credentials and managing user-related data.

If your desktop application doesn't involve data storage, data manipulation, or any form of data management, you might not need a traditional database. In such cases, you could use simpler file-based storage solutions or in-memory data structures to fulfill your application's needs.

Python provides various database options for desktop applications, ranging from SQLite (which is lightweight and doesn't require a separate server) to more robust databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL.

In summary, consider the data-related requirements of your desktop application and weigh the benefits of using a database against the complexity it might introduce. If data storage, retrieval, or complex data operations are integral to your application, incorporating a database into your tech stack can significantly enhance its capabilities and flexibility.
