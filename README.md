## Project Overview 


[google](google.com)

`ytconv3rt3r` is a versatile and user-friendly application that allows users to convert and download YouTube audio tracks into various audio file formats &mdash; including uncompressed audio (WAV), lossless compression (M4A), and lossy compression (MP3). 

Users will have the option to edit metadata for each audio track &mdash; including artist, title, genre, and other relevant details (which is especially crucial for users who use mixing/DJing software like `RekordBox` or `Serato`). 

&nbsp;
> - To enhance the user experience, an AI/ML-enhanced version of the project will be developed, which will automatically source and generate the correct metadata for each YouTube link.
>   
> - Additionally, users can edit metadata for each audio track, with the option of AI/ML assistance for automatic metadata retrieval or generation. 

&nbsp;

The project aims to cater to both web and desktop users, supporting both macOS and Windows operating systems.



---------------------

<a name="obj"></a>
### <ins>Objectives</ins>:

1. __<ins>Seamless Audio Conversion Experience</ins>:__
> - The primary objective of the `ytconv3rt3r` project is to provide users with a seamless and hassle-free experience when converting YouTube audio tracks into various audio formats.
> - The application should be easy to use, with a straightforward process for inputting YouTube video links and selecting desired audio formats.
> - Users should be able to initiate the conversion process with minimal effort and receive high-quality audio output promptly.
2. **<ins>Metadata Editing with or without AI/ML Assistance</ins>:**
> - Another key objective is to enable users to edit metadata associated with the converted audio tracks.
>> - Metadata includes information such as track title, artist name, album name, genre, and cover art.
> - Users should have the option to manually edit this metadata to ensure accurate and personalized information.
> - Additionally, the project aims to explore the integration of AI/ML technologies to assist users in automatically retrieving or generating metadata for the audio tracks, saving them time and effort.
3. **<ins>AI/ML Model for Metadata Retrieval or Generation</ins>:**
> - As part of the project's innovation, the development team aims to build and integrate an AI/ML model that can analyze audio content and retrieve or generate relevant metadata automatically.
>> - This AI/ML model would use techniques such as audio fingerprinting, natural language processing, and machine learning algorithms to identify key metadata details from the audio content itself or external sources.
> - By providing AI/ML assistance, the application can streamline the metadata editing process and enhance the overall user experience.
4. **<ins>Support for Web and Desktop Applications</ins>:**
> - The `ytconv3rt3r` project aims to be versatile and accessible to a wide range of users.
>> - To achieve this, the team plans to develop two versions of the application: a web-based version that users can access through their internet browsers, and a desktop application for macOS and Windows operating systems.
>> - This approach allows users to choose the platform that best suits their preferences and requirements.
5. **<ins>Cross-Platform Compatibility</ins>:**
> - In addition to supporting both web and desktop applications, cross-platform compatibility is a crucial objective of the project.
> - The team will ensure that the application functions smoothly on various operating systems and web browsers, allowing users to access and use it regardless of their chosen platform.
