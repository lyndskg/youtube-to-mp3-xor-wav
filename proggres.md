Apologies for the oversight. You are correct. In the "alpha" tech stack, some backend functionalities are written in C++ with Qt. Here's the corrected approach to start using the "alpha" tech stack for your project, with a focus on developing the C++ backend with Qt first:

1. **Setup Development Environment:**
   - [x] Install Python and set up a virtual environment for the backend development.
   - [ ] Install necessary Python dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   - [ ] Set up the necessary C++ and Qt development environment, including Qt Creator or CLion for C++ development.

2. **Backend (Data Processing and Business Logic):**
   - Create a new folder for the C++ backend within your project directory.
   - Start developing the C++ backend logic, data processing, and advanced functionalities using Qt.
   - Implement unit tests for the C++ backend using Google Test.

3. **Database (Data Storage):**
   - Use SQLite for lightweight data storage in the C++ backend. Set up the necessary database schema and models.

4. **APIs, Frameworks, and Libraries:**
   - Implement the web API using Flask in Python to handle server-side functionality.
   - Integrate the YouTube Data API into your Python backend to access and retrieve data from YouTube.

5. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Implement error handling and logging on the server-side using Python Logging.

6. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for the Python backend functionality using Pytest.
   - Perform testing and quality assurance on the Python backend to ensure its reliability.

7. **Desktop Application Development (Cross-platform):**
   - While developing the C++ backend, plan and prepare the structure for the cross-platform desktop application using Qt.

8. **Metadata Processing and AI/ML Integration:**
   - Implement metadata processing in the Python backend and integrate AI/ML models for metadata retrieval or generation.

9. **Frontend (User Interface):**
   - Once the C++ backend functionalities are ready and unit-tested, create the React frontend.
   - Connect the React frontend to the Python backend using RESTful APIs.

10. **User Interface Design and Styling:**
    - Design and style the React frontend to provide a modern and interactive user interface.

11. **Web APIs and HTTP Communication:**
    - Test the communication between the React frontend and Python backend through RESTful APIs.

12. **Desktop App Integration:**
    - Integrate the C++ and Qt-based desktop application with the Python backend to share functionalities and data.

13. **Audio Conversion:**
    - Implement audio conversion functionalities within the C++ and Qt-based desktop application using FFmpeg.

14. **Tools/Toolkits and Channels:**
    - Set up WebAssembly for running C++ code in web browsers and achieving native-like performance.

15. **IDEs:**
    - Choose an IDE that best suits your development needs: Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for Python, JavaScript, and C++ development, CLion for dedicated C++ development with Qt support, and PyCharm for Python development with Flask integration.

16. **Wireframes and Mockups:**
    - Create wireframes or mockups to visualize the UI/UX of your web app and desktop app before completing the frontend development.

17. **Architecture Planning:**
    - Plan the overall architecture of your project, defining how different components will interact and communicate with each other.

By developing the C++ backend with Qt first and writing unit tests, you can ensure that the core functionalities are working correctly and achieve a solid foundation for your project. Once the C++ backend is stable, you can proceed with frontend development, ensuring smooth integration and faster development turnaround time.
